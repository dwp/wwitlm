    <h2 class="heading-medium">3. Bringing it all together - DWP&rsquo;s labour market regime</h2>

    <p>The objectives, principles and intervention types discussed in Part 1 combine into a single, coherent labour market regime. Access to out-of-work benefits and labour market support is regulated by a series of contact points with Jobcentre Plus which seeks to influence claimant behaviour in order to encourage the quickest possible return to work.</p>

    <p>At the heart of the Jobcentre Plus regime is the Work Coach.  They are responsible for helping an unemployed person become an effective jobseeker, working with them to develop an individual tailored plan to achieve the fastest possible return to work. This includes agreeing and reviewing job goals and linked conditionality requirements in the Claimant Commitment, encouraging self-efficacy, whilst also identifying where extra support needed.  In between Work Coach interviews, progress with steps back to work are checked within fortnightly jobsearch reviews.</p>

    <p>As a consequence of the dynamism of the UK labour market, a large number of individuals receive out of work benefits for short durations, maintaining sufficient labour market attachment to return quickly to employment. The majority have left benefits by 6 months and 90% by 12 months into a JSA Claim.  In a typical cohort month, less than 10,000 JSA claimants are still on benefits at two years (96% off-flow rate) and less than 5,000 at four years (98% off flow).  The design of the regime recognises that many claimants are able, with light touch support, to take their own effective steps back into the labour market. However, fortnightly jobsearch reviews, are highly cost effective in reducing claim duration for this group. </p>

    <p>In contrast, it would not be cost-effective to provide more intensive support to all claimants at day one. Instead, active labour market measures (employment support) are targeted selectively by Work Coaches at those at greatest risk of becoming long term unemployed to try and avoid associated ‘scarring’, resulting in wider social costs and adverse inter-generational effects.</p>
