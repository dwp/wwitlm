    <h2 class="heading-medium">1. Rationale for state intervention</h2>

    <p>Government’s overall role in the labour market is to encourage flexibility, efficiency and fairness. The Department for Business Innovation and Skills works to promote growth and ensure the UK is a business-friendly and internationally competitive environment, working with them and the Devolved Administrations to strengthen the skills base, with HM Treasury controlling overall macroeconomic policy to deliver growth and employment.</p>

    <p>DWP’s focus is to increase the number of people in employment, intervening where market mechanisms are failing, or in support of wider societal objectives such as fairness. The Department increases employment through both tackling inactivity to increase participation and tackling unemployment to return people to work.</p>

    <p>There are strong economic, financial and social reasons to encourage high participation rates, from supporting growth and promoting social inclusion to improving the health, wellbeing and living standards of individual citizens.</p>

    <p>There is also a high degree of consensus about the benefits of bearing-down on frictional unemployment, by influencing individual job search behaviour. Filling vacancies more quickly improves overall productivity and reduces expenditure on benefits.</p>

    <p>There is similarly broad agreement on the value of maintaining labour market attachment and employability of unemployed people during periods of high cyclical unemployment to facilitate swift re-entry as conditions improve. The role of demand-side stimulus in reducing cyclical unemployment through spending and job creation, for instance major capital projects or targeted regeneration initiatives, is more contested.</p>

    <p>Many academics argue that structural unemployment, arising from a mismatch of skills within the economy, or displacement of jobs by technology, is addressed best through longer-term market correction: but there is a role for the state in sharing costs, and encouraging individuals towards opportunities for re-skilling.</p>
