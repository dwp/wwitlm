    <h2 class="heading-medium">2. Rationale for DWP&rsquo;s labour market interventions</h2>


<p>Rationale for DWP’s Labour Market Interventions</p>
<p>We intervene in the labour market in a number of different ways. These can be grouped into four main areas:</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">Passive Labour Market policies</h3>

<p>Passive Labour Market policies involve using the design of working age benefits to avoid distorting labour market behaviour. These:</p>

<p>Make work incentives as strong as possible, whilst maintaining appropriate levels of income protection, through withdrawing benefit at a constant rate as earnings are increased;</p>
<p>Discourage individual inflexibility, including wage reservation.</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">Activation Strategies</h3>

<p>Activation Strategies aim to maximise labour supply by drawing people closer to the labour market as a condition of benefit.  This may involve work-availability and work-search requirements, backed up by sanctions for non-compliance. These:</p>

<p>Shift people from inactive to active benefits to increase overall focus on moving into work</p>
<p>Make benefit payment conditional on activity to maintain labour market attachment, and ensure this is clearly understood by claimants;</p>
<p>Encourage an on-going focus on seeking and taking-up employment including through regular contact, such as FJRs;</p>
<p>Hold people close to the labour market and avoid pushing them back into inactivity;</p>
<p>Promote “work-first” as the right approach for most people in the short-term.</p>


<h3 class="heading-small">Public Employment Service</h3>

<p>Public Employment Service to provide free at point of delivery job-broking support for employers and jobseekers in line with Treaty of Rome obligations. This should:</p>

<p>Improve transparency and speed-up matches, for instance using UJ to make opportunities visible and get employers and employees together as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Increase mobility and flexibility through encouraging wider geographical search, adoption of varied working patterns and understanding of employer needs and recruitment practices.</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">Active labour market policies</h3>

<p>Active labour market policies are publicly funded interventions to improve the employability of selected groups within the labour market. These include:</p>

<p>Linking-up supply and demand and helping to even-out opportunities, including for disadvantaged groups, by providing work-focussed skills provision and employability support to equip individuals to compete and take up available opportunities, for example use of wage incentives or support for enterprise</p>
<p>Overcoming significant barriers, by providing extra support, such as workplace adjustments for disabled people, work experience for those detached from the labour market, intensive Adviser support for those less able to help themselves back into work, and/or support progression and independence from the state.</p>
<p>Be carefully targeted in order to avoid paying for deadweight, which is the amount of time individuals would have spent off-benefit without our support.</p>
<p>Avoid lock-in, which is people staying on provision causing a delay to their move into work.</p>
