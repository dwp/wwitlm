        <p>Financial incentives such as wage subsidies can work if they are sufficiently generous, but can have unintended side effects. Involving employers in return-to-work planning can reduce subsequent sick leave and be appreciated by employees, but this policy has not been taken up with the level of intensity that is likely to make a difference . The evidence reviewed here suggests that where adjustments are made by employers, particularly where employers can be flexible with work schedules, and give employees greater control over work demands, they may produce some promising results in terms of improved employment chances for disabled people.</p>

        <p>Individual placement and support is an evidence-based practice that has been shown to be more effective than other approaches in helping people with severe mental health problems gain and sustain employment. Research clearly demonstrates that it is the support provided to clients that most affects vocational outcomes. Reviews of the research literature repeatedly demonstrate little relationship between employment outcomes and diagnosis, severity of impairment and social skills. There is increasing evidence that the individual placement and support model can be generalised beyond the USA to the UK, indeed to other European countries, and beyond the clinical trial to routine clinical practice.</p>
