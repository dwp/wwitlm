Research used to inform this review includes participants from within and outside the UK. As such, evidence is likely to relate to a slightly more opaque group of individuals.</p>

    <h2 class="heading-medium">What affects this group&rsquo;s participation in the labour market</h2>

      <li>Issues regarding an individuals health condition</li>
      <li>Lack of job opportunities</li>
